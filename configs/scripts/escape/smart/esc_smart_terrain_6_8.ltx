;            FACTION CONTROLLED SMART_TERRAIN
;=================================================================
; this smart is an example on how to use faction_controlled = true
; when faction controll is enabled, the controlling faction is decided
; by the last npc who entered the smart. If he is the only faction present it will shift
; controll to his faction.
;
; default_faction is the starting faction for the smart.
; 
; If a respawn section has faction = community, then this respawn section will only work when 
; the smart is controlled by this faction. In this example, bandits or army can spawn here if
; one of these factions comes here. Otherwise this smart will not be a respawner.
; 
; Make sure you have props set up properly in simulation_object_props.ltx

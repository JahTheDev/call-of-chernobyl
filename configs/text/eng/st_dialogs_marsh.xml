        <text>Strelok? I think you have me confused old man. I've heard you have information about the Zone.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="cit_doctor_main_dialog_1">
        <text>Confused? Oh... I might have the information you seek, but I'll want you to do something in return.</text>

    <string id="cit_doctor_main_dialog_11">
        <text>Of course, what would you have me do?</text>

    <string id="cit_doctor_main_dialog_2">
        <text>The Zone has taken a heavy toll on me over the years, so I spend my final days here where it's quiet, but I would rather enjoy seeing my old friends once again.\nI fear Strelok and Guide may be dead, but I would very much like to speak with Fang and Ghost while there is still time. If you can find them and bring them here I would most appreciate your efforts.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="cit_doctor_main_dialog_21">
        <text>How long have you lived out here? Fang and Ghost are legendary stalkers, but they're both long dead. Fang was killed by a mercenary named Scar in Army Warehouses, and Ghost was found underneath Yantar in Lab X-16 about a year later. Did you really not know?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="cit_doctor_main_dialog_3">
        <text>They're both dead? Are you sure? I just... Oh alright... What is it that you want to know?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="cit_doctor_main_dialog_31">
        <text>Really, now you'll tell me so easily? I feel you are just wasting my time, old man.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="cit_doctor_main_dialog_4">
        <text>Wait! Don't go... I just didn't expect them to finish badly. When Strelok last came to visit, he gave me a key and coordinates to a stash in Pripyat.\nHe hasn't visited in years so I don't suppose he's fared much better. He was saying something about the Monolith, I didn't understand much of it and I'm not too sure he did either. Here, take it. One more thing... He spent a lot of time searching for clues of conspiration in underground labs, some kind of secret cover-up I believe. Perhaps you'll find your answers there.</text>

        <text>A fresh face! People around here call me Librarian. I'm the local bartender. I'll be glad to answer any questions you have. Sometimes I post job offerings or hear some interesting rumours, so check back often.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="marsh_stalker_barmen_start_dialog_2">
        <text>Hey, stalker. What do you need?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="marsh_stalker_tech_start_1">
        <text>Greetings, stalker. Can I be of assistance? Good tools are hard to come by in the Zone, but I can still repair your kit and do minor upgrades.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="marsh_stalker_medic_background">
        <text>Me? I used to be a guide believe it or not. I mostly stuck to the marshes, but often took stalkers to places quite far from here. But that was a different time, before they found that damned mercenary in the reeds with a mouth full of swamp water.
		      Every single day he'd forget the way in and out of the base and I'd have to take him not more than a five minute walk from here to the fishing hamlet and back. And then within only a few weeks he'd somehow managed to convince our leadership and most of our men to charge into the power station.
			  Needless to say neither he nor much of our faction came back from his madness.\nBy the end of it I had nobody left to guide but plenty of people to patch up.\nSo here I am. All because of that fuckin' crazy merc.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="marsh_stalker_barman_background">
        <text>I'm the bartender. I serve drinks, food, and keep the radio playing. It's not an exciting job, but still preferable to being out in the field. Been working here for quite a few years now, got caught on the inside of the swamps when the emission hit so I was pretty much stuck here.
		      Headed south like most people tried to but I was one of the few that didn't get picked off by bandits on the way. I searched out this base and joined up with Clear Sky. It was either that or die in a puddle somewhere. Spent the first few month as a grunt repelling the anarchists from our lookout posts
			  and then got the job as the new bartender after Cold got promoted. Naturally I accepted, I'd rather be shooting drinks than bullets. I just feel bad for those USS guys who were forced to intervene and occupy the north to try to calm the situation. But enough talk, how about a nice cold drink?</text>

    <string id="marsh_stalker_trader_background">
        <text>Spore's the name, I took over this gig about a year ago. Came to the Zone looking for wealth like everybody does and ran into a stalker called Nimble.\nFound out we shared a lot of the same talents, both got a lot of outside contacts,
		      good at trafficking goods in and out of the Zone and selling info. So when the Monolith resurgence happened and business was driven south, we followed. Managed to land myself a nice job here after he recommended me to Cold. Nimble used to be a member
			  of Clear Sky back in the day, y'know? Gives us both a nice little operation here, we have access to an army-free smuggling route through the swamps and Clear Sky gets first pick of everything we get our hands on. Pay Nimble a visit if you're ever
			  in the Cordon, last I heard he was hanging out around the rookie camp. If you ever need a hard to obtain weapon or outfit smuggled in from the outside he's the guy who peddles the goods.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="marsh_stalker_leader_background">
        <text>They call me Cold, I'm the leader of the Clear Sky faction. Been here since the beginning, other than Novikov, and Ivan in the other room. I used to be the bartender back in the old days before the former leadership went off on their expedition north.
		      When it was obvious they weren't coming back, those of us who were left looked for a new leader. After a few rounds on the house they wisely chose me. We found a new guy to the handle the bar, and I've worked on rebuilding the faction ever since.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="marsh_stalker_leader_about_csky1">
		<text>Wasn't Clear Sky destroyed?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marsh_stalker_leader_about_csky2">
		<text>Almost. After the emission that wiped out the original crew, anomalies sealed the marshes off from much of the Zone again. Spore joined us not long later and helped us smuggle in arms and other gear for our men.
		      Ivan used to be our old guide through the local area, he knows this place better than any of us. But we didn't have a medic and couldn't find one, and with no use for a guide anymore he really had no choice but to take up the practise unless he wanted go out and fight the mutants.
		      Grey's an old-timer too, though he prefers we call him Novikov now. Came back once he heard that we weren't all dead only the other year. His contacts within the Ecologists allowed us to start working with them to further our old research once the anomalies blocking the paths in began to clear.
			  Maybe you should speak to Spore about that, he often has a bunch of eggheads in need of an escort.</text>
	</string>
    <string id="marsh_stalker_tech_background">
        <text>Name's Novikov, though some here still call me Grey. I'm the guy who keeps everything working here, one of the first to join Clear Sky too. Did a bit of work for the eggheads up in Jupiter after this all collapsed - it was alright, but I'd never switch my workshop for
		      some shiny laboratory again. When I learnt that the boss had managed to pull everything back together I said my goodbyes and set up my old shop here. Called in on a few people I got to know there and set us up working with the Ecologists so we could get back
			  to finishing those old research papers Lebedev and Beanpolev spent so much time writing. Things aren't as great as they used to be, but I've got steady work. So what can I do for you?</text>

        <text>Yes? What do you want? Strelok? Is that you?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="cit_doctor_hello_dialog_21">
        <text>I've told you everything that I know.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="cit_doctor_main_dialog_0">
        <text>Strelok? I think you have me confused old man. I've heard you have information about the Zone.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="cit_doctor_main_dialog_1">
        <text>Confused? Oh... I might have the information you seek, but I'll want you to do something in return.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="cit_doctor_main_dialog_11">
        <text>Of course, what would you have me do?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="cit_doctor_main_dialog_2">
        <text>The Zone has taken a heavy toll on me over the years, so I spend my final days here where it's quiet, but I would rather enjoy seeing my old friends once again.\nI fear Strelok and Guide may be dead, but I would very much like to speak with Fang and Ghost while there is still time. If you can find them and bring them here I would most appreciate your efforts.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="cit_doctor_main_dialog_21">
        <text>How long have you lived out here? Fang and Ghost are legendary stalkers, but they're both long dead. Fang was killed by a mercenary named Scar in Army Warehouses, and Ghost was found underneath Yantar in Lab X-16 about a year later. Did you really not know?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="cit_doctor_main_dialog_3">
        <text>They're both dead? Are you sure? I just... Oh alright... What is it that you want to know?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="cit_doctor_main_dialog_31">
        <text>Really, now you'll tell me so easily? I feel you are just wasting my time, old man.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="cit_doctor_main_dialog_4">
        <text>Wait! Don't go... I just didn't expect them to finish badly. When Strelok last came to visit, he gave me a key and coordinates to a stash in Pripyat.\nHe hasn't visited in years so I don't suppose he's fared much better. He was saying something about the Monolith, I didn't understand much of it and I'm not too sure he did either. Here, take it. One more thing... He spent a lot of time searching for clues of conspiration in underground labs, some kind of secret cover-up I believe. Perhaps you'll find your answers there.</text>

    <string id="cit_doctor_main_dialog_41">
        <text>I see. Thanks, I appreciate your help.</text>

        <text>Now go, leave an old man in peace.</text>

        <text>A fresh face! People around here call me Librarian. I'm the local bartender. I'll be glad to answer any questions you have. Sometimes I post job offerings or hear some interesting rumours, so check back often.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="marsh_stalker_barmen_start_dialog_2">
        <text>Hey, stalker. What do you need?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="marsh_stalker_tech_start_1">
        <text>Greetings, stalker. Can I be of assistance? Good tools are hard to come by in the Zone, but I can still repair your kit and do minor upgrades.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="marsh_stalker_medic_background">
        <text>Me? I used to be a guide believe it or not. I mostly stuck to the marshes, but often took stalkers to places quite far from here. But that was a different time, before they found that damned mercenary in the reeds with a mouth full of swamp water.
		      Every single day he'd forget the way in and out of the base and I'd have to take him not more than a five minute walk from here to the fishing hamlet and back. And then within only a few weeks he'd somehow managed to convince our leadership and most of our men to charge into the power station.
			  Needless to say neither he nor much of our faction came back from his madness.\nBy the end of it I had nobody left to guide but plenty of people to patch up.\nSo here I am. All because of that fuckin' crazy merc.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="marsh_stalker_barman_background">
        <text>I'm a bartender. I serve drinks, food, and keep the radio playing. It's not an exciting job, but still preferable to being out in the field. But you're probably wondering why they call me Librarian? I like to keep everything well organised. And they like to mock when they see that I keep all my
		      commodities in their own little places, easy to find and get to. One day some guy said he was "off to see the librarian" and it just stuck. I think it has a nice ring to it though, don't you think? Better way to earn a nickname than Spore did for sure. But enough talk, how about a nice cold drink?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="marsh_stalker_trader_background">
        <text>There's not much more to tell that you can't already see. I'm the local trader.\nI purchase and sell equipment and keep our men ready to fight. Spore's the name, because of... That's just the name I ended up with. Nothing special.\nWas there something you wanted?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="marsh_stalker_trader_background2">
		<text>Why do they call the trader "Spore"?</text>
	</string>
    <string id="marsh_stalker_trader_background3">
        <text>He works with that loner near the rookie camp, you know? Helping each other smuggle and move goods to and from the Zone? Well one day he came storming in shouting about how the medical equipment was "causing interference with his PDA uplink" or
		      some techie nonsense. Now this was quite unlike him, so a few guys started snooping through his PDA messages to see what was up when he was out back sorting new inventory. Turns out the bastard's been having his buddy import fungal cream for him for months
			  and he was having supply problems. Ever wondered why Beard stopped producing that mushroom tea? Nobody could stomach the stuff after news about Spore's foot fungus became campfire talk. We used it to come up with all sorts of different names for him,
			  but "Spore" was the only one that really stuck.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="marsh_stalker_leader_background">
        <text>They call me Cold, I'm the leader of the Clear Sky faction. Been here since the beginning, other than Novikov, and Ivan in the other room. I used to be the bartender back in the old days before the former leadership went off on their expedition north.
		      When it was obvious they weren't coming back, those of us who were left looked for a new leader. After a few rounds on the house they wisely chose me. We found a new guy to the handle the bar, and I've worked on rebuilding the faction ever since.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="marsh_stalker_leader_about_csky1">
		<text>Wasn't Clear Sky destroyed?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marsh_stalker_leader_about_csky2">
		<text>Almost. After the emission that wiped out the original crew, anomalies sealed the marshes off from much of the Zone again. Spore joined us not long later and helped us smuggle in arms and other gear for our men.
		      Ivan used to be our old guide through the local area, he knows this place better than any of us. But we didn't have a medic and couldn't find one, and with no use for a guide anymore he really had no choice but to take up the practise unless he wanted go out and fight the mutants.
		      Grey's an old-timer too, though he prefers we call him Novikov now. Came back once he heard that we weren't all dead only the other year. His contacts within the Ecologists allowed us to start working with them to further our old research once the anomalies blocking the paths in began to clear.
			  Maybe you should speak to Spore about that, he often has a bunch of eggheads in need of an escort.</text>
	</string>
    <string id="marsh_stalker_tech_background">
        <text>Name's Novikov, though some here still call me Grey. I'm the guy who keeps everything working here, one of the first to join Clear Sky too. Did a bit of work for the eggheads up in Jupiter after this all collapsed - it was alright, but I'd never switch my workshop for
		      some shiny laboratory again. When I learnt that the boss had managed to pull everything back together I said my goodbyes and set up my old shop here. Called in on a few people I got to know there and set us up working with the Ecologists so we could get back
			  to finishing those old research papers Lebedev and Beanpolev spent so much time writing. Things aren't as great as they used to be, but I've got steady work. So what can I do for you?</text>

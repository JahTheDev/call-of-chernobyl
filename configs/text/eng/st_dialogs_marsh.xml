        <text>Yes? What do you want? Strelok? Is that you?</text>

    <string id="cit_doctor_hello_dialog_21">
        <text>I've told you everything that I know.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="cit_doctor_main_dialog_0">
        <text>Strelok? I think you have me confused old man. I've heard you have information about the Zone.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="cit_doctor_main_dialog_1">
        <text>Confused? Oh... I might have the information you seek, but I'll want you to do something in return.</text>

    <string id="cit_doctor_main_dialog_11">
        <text>Of course, what would you have me do?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="cit_doctor_main_dialog_2">
        <text>The Zone has taken a heavy toll on me over the years, so I spend my final days here where it's quiet, but I would rather enjoy seeing my old friends once again.\nI fear Strelok and Guide may be dead, but I would much like to speak with Fang and Ghost while there is still time. If you can find them and bring them here I would most appreciate your efforts.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="cit_doctor_main_dialog_21">
        <text>How long have you lived out here? Fang and Ghost are legendary stalkers, but they're both long dead. Fang was killed by a mercenary named Scar in Army Warehouses, and Ghost was found underneath Yantar in Lab X-16 about a year later. Did you really not know?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="cit_doctor_main_dialog_3">
        <text>They're both dead? Are you sure? I just... Oh alright... What is it that you want to know?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="cit_doctor_main_dialog_31">
        <text>Really, now you'll tell me so easily? I feel you are just wasting my time, old man.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="cit_doctor_main_dialog_4">
        <text>Wait! Don't go... I just didn't expect them to finish badly. When Strelok last came to visit, he gave me a key and coordinates to a stash in Pripyat Plaza.\nHe hasn't visited in years so I don't suppose he's fared much better. Perhaps you'll find your answers there. He was saying something about the Monolith, I didn't understand much of it and I'm not too sure he did either. Here, take it.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="cit_doctor_main_dialog_41">
        <text>I see. Thanks, I appreciate your help.</text>

        <text>Now go, leave an old man in peace.</text>

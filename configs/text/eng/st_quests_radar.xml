		<text>You have to get the protective prototype of the psi helmet to cover yourself against the Brain Scorcher. The coordinates of the bunker are well known, but so far nobody gone there alive. Don't forget that the prototype can't protect against the emission forever, so you must get to the bunker under the antennae and shut down the Scorcher. All you have to do is to get to the antennae, and switch them off.</text>

        <text>There's a pseudodog. A large specimen, but quite beaten up. On the other hand it's a very fierce one, just like my mother-in-law.</text>

    <string id="bar_arena_manager_game_200">
        <text>Deal. One more thing, put a stake on the time that you require to kill it. If you manage it - you win, otherwise - you lose. The less the time taken, the bigger the reward won.</text>

        <text>There is a freak in a gas-mask, called a snork. Thin and feeble-looking but quite agile.</text>

        <text>Great, we'll get everything ready. Enter the arena.</text>

        <text>This time we've got true luck. We caught a young bloodsucker. Still dumb, but already with bad manners.</text>

        <text>Go ahead, get the bloodsucker ready.</text>
    </string>

        <text>A bloodsucker? Fuck that!</text>

        <text>What? You love bloodsuckers now? When did you join Freedom?</text>

    <string id="bar_arena_manager_game_5">
        <text>This time we've a fat little midget in a black cloack - the locals call it a burer.</text>

        <text>Fat and short? Easy. I'll do it.</text>

        <text>He hardly reaches your waist in height. And he scares you?</text>

        <text>Today is a special day. I don't know where they found... him... but he's a real beast.</text>

        <text>Deal. I'll put him out of his misery.</text>

        <text>I don't plan on dying today. Get someone else to kill him.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_manager_game_621">
        <text>Well, frankly even I find the beast scary. But I'm not fighting in the arena, so who cares?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_manager_info_0">
        <text>Got a couple of questions.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_manager_info_1">
        <text>Shoot.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_manager_info_10">
        <text>I have no more questions.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_manager_info_11">
        <text>What is this establishment?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_manager_info_111">
        <text>This is the arena, my little business. A place where stalkers can test their mettle and earn their fame by fighting against the horrors of the Zone.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_manager_info_12">
        <text>How do you get the mutants here?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_manager_info_121">
        <text>We made a deal with Duty, instead of killing all the mutants they find they bring the weaker ones here in exchange for cash. Duty gets paid, the mutants get killed, and then I get paid. Everybody wins.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_manager_info_13">
        <text>Where are you from?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_manager_info_131">
        <text>I am from many places. I heard about this little backwater and understood that I could earn a good little penny here. So here I am.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_manager_rules_0">
        <text>What are the rules?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_manager_rules_1">
        <text>Oh, the rules are pretty simple. I invented them myself. There's a cage, and a mutant is let inside the cage. You pay money and tell me the time you need to kill the monster. If you make it - you win, if you don't - I win.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_manager_start_11">
        <text>I've got myself a new pet. Want to try yourself against it?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_manager_start_21">
        <text>So, what are you waiting for? Get into the cage.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_manager_start_31">
        <text>Sorry, there's nothing to fight against yet. Wait for a day or two until we can catch a new mutant.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_manager_start_41">
        <text>There you are! Well done! Here's your win. If you desire another fight for money then just drop in whenever.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_manager_start_51">
        <text>Sorry, bro, but you lose. Come again next time if you want.</text>

        <text>There's a pseudodog. A large specimen, but quite beaten up. On the other hand, a very fierce one, same as my mother-in-law.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_manager_game_200">
        <text>Deal. One more thing. Put a stake on the time to kill the monster within. If you manage it - you win, otherwise - you lose. The less the time taken, the bigger the reward won.</text>

        <text>There is a freak in a gas-mask, called a snork. Thin and feeble-looking but quite agile.</text>

        <text>The fight is over. Welcome to the lounge.</text>

        <text>Got scared by a half-rotten gas-masked freak?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_manager_game_4">
        <text>This time we've got true luck. We caught a young bloodsucker. Still dumb, but already with bad manners.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_manager_game_41">
        <text>Go ahead, get the bloodsucker ready.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_manager_game_42">
        <text>No, I don't want to fight against the bloodsucker.</text>

        <text>Aha! Got scared? Such as I expected.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_manager_game_5">
        <text>This time we've got a little midget in a black cloack - a burer.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_manager_game_51">
        <text>Bring this one out.</text>
    </string>

    <string id="bar_arena_manager_game_521">
        <text>He hardly reaches your waist in height. And he scares you?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_manager_game_6">
        <text>It's a special day today. Don't know where they caught him, but it's a true beast.</text>

    <string id="bar_arena_manager_game_61">
        <text>Deal. Bring me the beast.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_manager_game_62">
        <text>No, the beast is too much.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_manager_game_621">
        <text>Well, frankly even I find the beast scary. But I will never fight in the arena, so who cares?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_manager_info_0">
        <text>Got a couple of questions.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_manager_info_1">
        <text>Shoot.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_manager_info_10">
        <text>No more questions here.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_manager_info_11">
        <text>What is this establishment?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_manager_info_111">
        <text>This is the arena, my little business. A place where stalkers can test their mettle and earn their fame by fighting the horrors of the Zone.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_manager_info_12">
        <text>How do you get the mutants here?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_manager_info_121">
        <text>We made a deal with the Duty, instead of killing all the mutants they find they bring the weaker ones here in exchange for cash. Duty gets paid, the mutants get killed, and then I get paid. Everybody wins.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_manager_info_13">
        <text>Where are you from?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_manager_info_131">
        <text>I am from many places. I heard about this little backwater and understood that I can earn a good little penny here. So here I am.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_manager_rules_0">
        <text>What are the rules?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_manager_rules_1">
        <text>Oh, the rules are pretty simple. I invented them myself. There's a cage, and a mutant is let inside the cage. You pay money and choose the time you need to kill the monster. If you make it - you win, if you don't - I win.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_manager_start_11">
        <text>I've got myself a new pet. Want to try yourself against it?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_manager_start_21">
        <text>So, what are you waiting for? Get into the cage.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_manager_start_31">
        <text>Sorry, there's nobody to fight against yet. Wait for a day or two until we can catch a new mutant.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_manager_start_41">
        <text>There you are! Well done! Here's your win. If you desire another fight for money - drop in.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_manager_start_51">
        <text>Sorry, bro, but you lose. Come again next time if you want.</text>

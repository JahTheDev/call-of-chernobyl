		<text>The document contains a short report on how Fang and Strelok infiltrated the laboratory under the Generators and found a suspicious-looking door. Fang said that he'd put together a decoder for the electronic lock for their next visit, after which they had to run for their lives. The manuscript contains directions for finding the door, and states that there were hordes of Monolith patrols. It seems that approaching the Monolith directly is extremely dangerous - last time they were avoided by going through the sarcophagus above the destroyed reactor.</text>

	</string>
	
	<string id="ls_tip_1">
		<text>Rank has eight different levels, starting at 'Rookie' and finishing at 'Legend'. It can be increased through almost any in-game activity, and certain features may require reaching a high rank before they can be used.</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="ls_tip_2">
		<text>Achievements can be unlocked through certain in-game accomplishments or by reaching statistical milestones. Every achievement is unlocked with an appropriate reward, which can be viewed in the PDA.</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="ls_tip_3">
		<text>Basic, advanced and expert tools are required by most mechanics in order to perform certain upgrades on weapons and outfits. Such items can often be found in stashes received as rewards for completing tasks.</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="ls_tip_4">
		<text>Sleep deprivation is an optional feature where the passage of time and using consumables will gradually drain the player, eventually requiring them to rest when prompted. Failing to do so may have dire consequences.</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="ls_tip_5">
		<text>Helicopter gunships can be seen patrolling many of the Zone's locations. When engaged in combat, members of the helicopter's faction may often call on it for air support to help destroy attacking or defending forces.</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="ls_tip_6">
		<text>Ironman mode gives a true sense of mortality. When the player is killed, all saves for that specific character are deleted and can never be restored. Pick your faction and starting location wisely.</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="ls_tip_7">
		<text>Gunsmith and sewing kits are used to repair your weapons and outfits respectively when out in the field. Each allows up to three uses, and are often used to repair items of greater value than the kits themselves.</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="ls_tip_8">
		<text>Backpacks can be bought or found, and then used to create a custom stash. Stashes created by the player are never despawned nor are they ever looted by other stalkers. They are permanent until all items are removed.</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="ls_tip_9">
		<text>Sleeping bags are a great way to rest in the Zone if you are unable to find a decent bed to sleep in. They can be purchased from most major traders, or potentially found in another stalker's stash.</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="ls_tip_10">
		<text>Truck Cemetery is a large graveyard of irratiated agricultural, civilian and military vehicles. As a great place to hide a stash, an eagle-eyed stalker may find many valuables amongst the wreckage.</text>

		<text>Excerpt #</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="ls_tip_1">
		<text>Rank has eight different levels, starting at 'Rookie' and finishing at 'Legend'. It can be increased through almost any in-game activity, and certain features may require reaching a high rank before they can be used.</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="ls_tip_2">
		<text>Achievements can be unlocked through certain in-game accomplishments or by reaching statistical milestones. Every achievement is unlocked with an appropriate reward, which can be viewed in the PDA.</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="ls_tip_3">
		<text>Basic, advanced and expert tools are required by most mechanics in order to perform certain upgrades on weapons and outfits. Such items can often be found in stashes received as rewards for completing tasks.</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="ls_tip_4">
		<text>Sleep deprivation is an optional feature where the passage of time and using consumables will gradually drain the player, eventually requiring them to rest when prompted. Failing to do so may have dire consequences.</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="ls_tip_5">
		<text>Helicopter gunships can be seen patrolling many of the Zone's locations. When engaged in combat, members of the helicopter's faction may often call on it for air support to help destroy attacking or defending forces.</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="ls_tip_6">
		<text>Ironman mode gives a true sense of mortality. When the player is killed, all saves for that specific character are deleted and can never be restored. Pick your faction and starting location wisely.</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="ls_tip_7">
		<text>Gunsmith and sewing kits are used to repair your weapons and outfits respectively when out in the field. Each allows up to three uses, and are often used to repair items of greater value than the kits themselves.</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="ls_tip_8">
		<text>Backpacks can be bought or found, and then used to create a custom stash. Stashes created by the player are never despawned nor are they ever looted by other stalkers. They are permanent until all items are removed.</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="ls_tip_9">
		<text>Sleeping bags are a great way to rest in the Zone if you are unable to find a decent bed to sleep in. They can be purchased from most major traders, or potentially found in another stalker's stash.</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="ls_tip_10">
		<text>Truck Cemetery is a large graveyard of irradiated agricultural, civilian and military vehicles. As a great place to hide a stash, an eagle-eyed stalker may find many valuables amongst the wreckage.</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="ls_tip_11">
		<text>Artefact types are indicative of the anomalies they are found in. Want one that boosts your burn resistance? Search for a 'Burner' or 'Comet' anomaly and go hunting with your detector.</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="ls_tip_12">
		<text>Completing tasks for factions will increase your goodwill with them. As it increases, their traders will gradually offer you greater discounts on their goods and services.</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="ls_tip_13">
		<text>As you achieve more in-game your rank will increase, the available ranks are as follows: 'Rookie', 'Trainee', 'Experienced', 'Professional', 'Veteran', 'Expert', 'Master' and 'Legend'.</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="ls_tip_14">
		<text>Most tasks can be cancelled after you have agreed to complete them. You can do this by speaking with the stalker who gave you the task. However, cancelling a task will decrease your reputation and goodwill.</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="ls_tip_15">
		<text>Reputation is a representation of how a stalker is viewed by their faction. It is gained and lost by helping or harming non-hostile stalkers respectively.</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="ls_tip_16">
		<text>Reputation is dynamic and can frequently change, the available reputations are as follows: 'Terrible', 'Dreary', 'Awful', 'Bad', 'Neutral', 'Good', 'Great', 'Brilliant' and 'Excellent'.</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="ls_tip_17">
		<text>Darkscape is a large forested area between Cordon and Dark Valley. While there are few major reasons to visit, it's often used as a hideout for loners and bandits on the run with a price on their heads.</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="ls_tip_18">
		<text>Remember to ask regular stalkers if they have any jobs available. Just because they aren't anybody important doesn't mean they won't be willing to pay you to do their dirty work.</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="ls_tip_19">
		<text>Rostok's arena hosts two types of competitions: the traditional fights where stalkers battle each other for cash rewards, or challenges where they attempt to kill increasingly harder mutants.</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="ls_tip_20">
		<text>Online exclusion radius can be set via the game options and defaults to 25m. It creates a no-spawn area around the player preventing mutants and other stalkers spawning unfairly and dangerously close.</text>
	</string>
